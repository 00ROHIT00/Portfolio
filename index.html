            <p>Hey, My name is Rohith R. I live in Kottayam. I've always liked the Technology field, so I chose to learn some programming languages from YouTube.
                I also enjoy listening to music, playing games, or just hanging out with friends. I'm always keen on discovering new things about anything I'm interested in 
                and is always trying to stay in touch with all the technological innovations happening around us.

                <p><br>I completed my 10th grade at Girideepam Bethany Central School, Vadavathoor. For 11th and 12th grades, I attended Devi Vilasom VHSE, Kumaranallor.
                     I chose BCA as my undergraduate course and studied at Saintgits College of Applied Sciences, Pathamuttom. Since then, I have learned a lot about the programming languages 
                     I use today, significantly enhancing my skills and knowledge in the field.</p></div>

        <p class="projectIntro">The following are some of the projects that I've done in the past. Most of these are using HTML, CSS and and JavaScript. Some of these project also use PHP and MySQL.</p>

            <li> <span>CINEWISE</span> <br> (Movie Search Engine)</li>
            <p>CineWise is a movie search engine. It was my BCA Final Year project. CINEWISE allows the user to 
            search for any movies with their title, release year, rating, or even their genre. It basically used an 
            database to search for the movies. The users can also register or sign into their accounts to save their watch later playlist.
            The Admins can see all the movies in the database, as well as edit/delete them. The user interface of the whole website is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            Mostly, HTML and CSS was used and hence it is a pretty lightweight website. I used Javascript as the frontend and backend. PHP and MySQL was used to store and 
            retrieve the data about the movies, from the database.

                    <li> <span>Weather App</span> <br> (Using API)</li>
                    <p>The Weather App was made as an introduction to JavaScript and on how to use Application Programming Interfacee or APIs to get data from various sources.
                        The API used for the project is the <b>OpenWeatherMap API</b>. The API provided many information like the current temperature, wind speed, wind direction, high temperatur, low temperature etc.
                        The user could search for any city on the search box, and the inputted term would be forwarded to the API link along with my API key. We could then use the response from the API to acquire the real time termperature.
